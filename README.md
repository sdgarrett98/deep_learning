# Alphabet Soup Charity Model: Deep Learning Classifier

## Overview

This project aims to build a deep learning model that predicts the success of applications for funding at Alphabet Soup, a fictitious charity organization. The model utilizes a historical dataset containing various features related to applicants, allowing for classification of applications as successful or unsuccessful.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook:** The Jupyter notebook used in this project guides through the data preprocessing steps, model development, training, and evaluation.
- **Data:** A dataset with both features and a target variable (`IS_SUCCESSFUL`) was used to train and test the model.
- **Model:** A Sequential Neural Network model was developed using TensorFlow and Keras.
